 # CHEWSY (iOS App)
An allergy-friendly restaurant locator for NYC

MOTIVATION
As a person with many many food allergies myself, I have always struggled to find trustworthy and credible restaurants that I was sure could accommodate my dietary restrictions. I also grew up with an older brother who happens to have a very serious peanut allergy, and there have been many instances where he had to be hospitalized after a waiter/restaurant did not prepare his food properly.
For this reason, me and my family are always very hesitant to go out to eat- which is very unfortunate. If only there was an application/service that would help you find restaurants in your area that were CREDIBILY KNOWN to be able to handle your specific allergy professionally... enter Chewsy! ;)
